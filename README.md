# SQL

> The jupyter notebook intends to show **how to write** some important **SQL queries** and **statements** - for **retrieving data from a database** and **performing actions on a database** - such as: 
> - Creating a primary key
> - Selecting a given number of rows to display from a given to table 
> - Count the number of records of a table
> - Count the distinct 'accident indexes' from each table
> - Select the columns/fields of our interest
> - Delete records in both tables
> - Update an existing record
> - Discover the correlation between the day of the week and the number of accidents and visualize data using Matplotlib
> - Find out how severe the accidents were and visualize data using Matplotlib
> - Retrive the total number of accidents by vehicle type and sort in descending order of number of accidents
> - Find out what was the accident severity by vehicle type and for just a specific vehicle type, for instance, cars, and also visualize data regarding accident severity where cars were involved using Matplotlib
> - Compute the average severity of accidents involving cars
> - Retrieve the accident severity by Age Band of the Driver and sort in descending order by the number of accidents. For just a specific age band of the driver, for instance, 21-25 years old
> - Create a new table, with the fields/columns of our interest, to combine the rows of both tables based on the same 'accident_index' using the Inner Join clause
> - Compute the number of accidents by age band of driver and day of the week using the partition by clause
> - Insert multiple rows into the new table
>

- You can find the two **datasets** regarding Road Safety Data 2020 in UK with which I created a **database** with **2 tables** [here](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data)
