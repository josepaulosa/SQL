> The jupyter notebook intends to show **how to write** some important **SQL queries** and **statements** - for **retrieving data from a database** and **Performing actions on a database** - such as: 
> - Creating a primary key
> - Selecting a given number of rows to display from a given to table 
> - Count the number of records of a table
> - Count the distinct 'accident indexes' from each table
> - Select the columns/fields of our interest
> - Delete records in both tables
> - How to update an existing record
> - Discover the correlation between the day of the week and the number of accidents and visualize data using Matplotlib
> - Find out how severe the accidents were and visualize data using Matplotlib
> - Learn which was the total number of accidents by vehicle type and sort in descending order of number of accidents
> - Find out what was the accident severity by vehicle type and for just a specific vehicle type, for instance, cars, and also visualize data regarding accident severity where cars were involved using Matplotlib
